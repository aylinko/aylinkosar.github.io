As you already know, my name is Aylin, based in the USA. In 2019, I received a Masters in Information Technology and Analytics from Rutgers University and started out in academia. First by analyzing data and using creative skills such as editing and recording video content for educational Youtube videos for one department at Rutgers while working on my Masters degree. Once I graduated with my Masters, I moved on to teaching first by becoming a Teaching Assistant and then eventually a Lecturer at the School of Business at Rutgers University - Camden. As a Lecturer, I taught mainly data cleaning, data analytics, and visualization using R and Tableau to grad students.  

Now, I am interested in using my diverse skills, background, and abilities to provide freelancing services that would best service individuals. As a freelancer, I can provide quality analysis and visualizations for those who need analytic work done or anything that is needed to help you have a successful business.
