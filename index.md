A little about me, in 2019 I received a Masters in Information Technology and Analytics from Rutgers University. My experience includes teaching two online graduate level courses, Big Data Analytics and Visualization and Special Topic in Management: Analytics and Visualization, at the School of Business at Rutgers University - Camden during the Fall 2019 and Fall 2021 semester. For both courses, the students were taught how to use R for data analytics, visualize data, analyze and create machine learning models, in addition to creating visualizations and a dashboard using Tableau. 

Currently, I am job hunting for any position, ideally outside of academia, while working on a personal project. My project is a site to help individuals learn how to program in R, Python and how to use Tableau. 

Other than the above, when I am not working on something, I enjoy taking a break by watching Netflix and travel to as many places as I can, internationally and locally, whenever there is a chance to.
