I graduated with a Masters in Information Technology and Analytics from Rutgers University in the year of 2019. My experience includes teaching two online graduate level courses, Big Data Analytics and Visualization and Special Topic in Management: Analytics and Visualization, at the School of Business at Rutgers University - Camden during the Fall 2019 and Fall 2021 semester. Both courses were related to using R to conduct data analysis, statistical tests, maching learning models, and visualizing data in addition to Tableau. I have a publication named Determining the Main Factors for Recividism in Boston, published in the International Journal of Applied Decision Sciences. The publication dealt with using stop and frisk data from Boston's open data site and prison data to find out why recividism occured within Boston.  

Currently, I am working on two projects, a tutorial site related to using the R language to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data and eventually use Python as well. The second project, is a book related to using map visualizions to study the number of bike riderships within NYC using QGIS and Adobe Illustrator. In addition, I am currently job hunting for any position outside of academia. 

Other than the above and catching up on Netflix, I enjoy traveling to as many places as I can.
